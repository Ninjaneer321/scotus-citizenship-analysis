# SCOTUS citizenship analysis

This is the analysis we ran for our story on the SCOTUS decision to potentially add a citizenship question to the Census, which would take effect in 2020.

We use the Census API to gather population information on political districts in Texas. The American Community Survey tracks information on noncitizens in Texas. The code is the analysis.ipynb notebook.

All files that were analyzed are placed in the "output" directory. A data dictionary of the columns in each of these files can be found in [this Google document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fYve5xIhRYPcuq11CCQt3IHIHA3xqLgucHAeJ_lhJS8/edit).

Note: Raw files have not been updated to Github.
