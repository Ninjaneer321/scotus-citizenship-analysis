# SCOTUS citizenship analysis

This is the analysis we ran for our story on the SCOTUS decision to add a citizenship question to the Census. This would take effect in 2020.

We use the Census API to gather population information on legislative districts in Texas. The Census has information on non-citizens, for istance. The code is in separate Jupyter notebooks, all starting with "analysis_" in their filenames.

All files that were analyzed are placed in the "output" directory. A data dictionary of the columns in each of these files can be found in [this Google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1HAnx3IL3gDyz1dsyeOcK0v1N7Se3tyfr).

We also have a "edits" directory for files that were modified but still further analysis before we move them over to the "output" directory.

Note: Because of large file sizes, all raw files have not been updated to Github.
