# SCOTUS Citizenship analysis

This is the analysis we ran for our story in preparion of the SCOTUS decision on adding a citizenship question the Census. This would take effect in 2020.

We use the Census API to gather population information on legislative districts in Texas. The Census has information on non-citizens, for istance. The code is in separate Jupyter notebooks, all starting with "analysis_".

All findings are placed in the "output" directory. A data dictionary of the columns in each of these files can be found in [this Google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1HAnx3IL3gDyz1dsyeOcK0v1N7Se3tyfr).

Note: Because of large file sizes, all raw files have not been updated to Github.
